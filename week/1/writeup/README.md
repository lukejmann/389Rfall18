### Part 2 (75 pts)

As a developer for the company, I would first tell my boss and make every reasonable attempt to implore him to take the actions necessary to resolve this issue. If the boss refuses to take the proper steps to address the issue and thus adequately protect the safety of the consumers, I would then tell a consumer watchdog with the hope that they would be able to use their leverage to force the company to take right actions. I can't imagine any situation wherein taking the issues to the public would be the right thing to do: there is too much of a risk of harm by bad actors. 

If the company is unwilling to postpone the ECU's release, I would pursue routes with the consumer watchdog and other organizations until the company takes the morally correct action of delaying the release. Although disavowing my obligation to the company could be considered amoral in many cases, because the company is knowingly taking actions that could physically endanger consumers, any moral obligation to the company ought to be considered void. 

If I do nothing after the company refuses to take the proper actions, I would feel morally but not legally or fiscally responsible for any harm that results. This is because if I were to take an action that was not detrimental to me  (informing a watchdog), I would be in a unique position to be able to drastically reduce the risk that many consumers might face. The likelihood and magnitude of good done would far outweigh the negative consequences.
